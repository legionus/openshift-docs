====
This section describes functionality that is experimental and may change
in the future.

== Overview

Sometimes the data stored in the OpenShift Container Registry may differ
from the data in the {product-title} cluster's etcd. It means that either
the {product-title} cluster's database contains references to data that
does not exist on the OpenShift Container Registry's storage, or the
OpenShift Container Registry storage has data that is not referenced in
the {product-title} cluster's database. This situation may occur as a result
of an error or accidental deletion.

There are two classes of problems:

. The {product-title} cluster's database contains references to
non-existent blobs. This usually happens due to storage damage. In this
case, such imagestreams/images are not possible to use and any pull will
end with an error. The way to fix such images is to push them onto the
OpenShift Container Registry again to restore the blobs. The problem is
to understand which imagestreams were damaged.

. Necessary images were removed from the {product-title} cluster's
database, but remained in the OpenShift Container Registry storage. This
may occur due to incorrect pruning settings or due to accidental manual
removal. In this case, the problem is to restore the references in the
{product-title} cluster's database in order to prevent blobs from being
deleted during the xref:#hard-pruning-registry[hard pruning] process.

== Preparation

Before starting, you must give the registry's service account permissions to
change the {product-title} cluster's database:
+
----
$ service_account=$(oc get -n default \
    -o jsonpath=$'system:serviceaccount:{.metadata.namespace}:{.spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName}\n' \
    dc/docker-registry)
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin ${service_account}
----

[NOTE]
====
After completion of the process of restoring the database and storage
consistency, do not forget to revoke the granted privileges.
====

== Find broken objects

To list broken imagestream tags and images run (no changes are actually made):
+
----
$ oc -n default \
    exec -i -t "$(oc -n default get pods -l deploymentconfig=docker-registry \
    -o jsonpath=$'{.items[0].metadata.name}\n')" \
    -- /usr/bin/dockerregistry -experimental -restore-mode=check
----

If the {product-title} cluster's database is too big and you do not want make
full check then you can limit the scan and check only the database or only the storage:
+
----
$ oc -n default \
    exec -i -t "$(oc -n default get pods -l deploymentconfig=docker-registry \
    -o jsonpath=$'{.items[0].metadata.name}\n')" \
    -- /usr/bin/dockerregistry -experimental -restore-mode=check-database
$ oc -n default \
    exec -i -t "$(oc -n default get pods -l deploymentconfig=docker-registry \
    -o jsonpath=$'{.items[0].metadata.name}\n')" \
    -- /usr/bin/dockerregistry -experimental -restore-mode=check-storage
----

You can also limit the namespace you want to scan:
+
----
$ oc -n default \
    exec -i -t "$(oc -n default get pods -l deploymentconfig=docker-registry \
    -o jsonpath=$'{.items[0].metadata.name}\n')" \
    -- /usr/bin/dockerregistry -experimental -restore-mode=check -restore-namespace=myproject
----

If some image manifest does not exist on the OpenShift Container Registry's
storage, then you will see a message like follow:

----
Broken imagestream tag "myproject/ubuntu:latest" in position 0: image "sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19": unknown blob
----

or if blob does not exist:

----
Broken imagestream tag "myproject/ubuntu:latest" in position 0: image blob "sha256:d42beb8ded595df5627ad4ef31bf528a6fdbfbd11d82f9023152738d6b05a7fa": unknown blob
----

If you have images which reference a non-existent blob, but which are not
in any imagestream, then the message will look like:

----
Broken image "sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19": unknown blob
----

If the storage has an image that is not in an imagestream, then the
message will look like this:

----
Would add image "sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19" to imagestream "myproject/ubuntu" with tag "lost-found-be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19"
----

== Restore

Some data can be recovered, but in some cases the data is lost and must
be restored from an external copy.

=== Restore imagestreams

To recreate lost imagestream tags based on the state of the storage, use the command:
+
----
$ oc -n default \
    exec -i -t "$(oc -n default get pods -l deploymentconfig=docker-registry \
    -o jsonpath=$'{.items[0].metadata.name}\n')" \
    -- /usr/bin/dockerregistry -experimental -restore-mode=recover
----

Unfortunately, imagestream tag names are not stored on the storage.
Therefore, they can not be restored. Also, if the imagestream tag had a
history, then it also could not be restored. Tag creation time will also
be lost. All images from the history will be restored as separate tags.
The recovered tag names will have the form: `lost-found-<DIGEST>`. 

=== Restore data on storage

The only way to restore data that was lost from the {product-name} Container Registry's storage
is to re-push the content.

For example, if the database check showed any of following messages:

----
Broken imagestream tag "myproject/ubuntu:latest" in position 0: image "sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19": unknown blob
Broken imagestream tag "myproject/ubuntu:latest" in position 0: image blob "sha256:d42beb8ded595df5627ad4ef31bf528a6fdbfbd11d82f9023152738d6b05a7fa": unknown blob
Broken image "sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19": unknown blob
----

you will need to locate a copy of image
`sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19`
and push it to the {product-name} Container registry as `myproject/ubuntu:latest`.
The same image can be in the {product-name} Container Registry's storage under different names.
You can use any one to re-push it. You can get the reference for the image
or the imagestream tag by the following commands:

----
$ oc get -n myproject istag/ubuntu:latest -o 'jsonpath={.image.dockerImageReference}'
172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/ubuntu@sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19

$ oc get images sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19 -o 'jsonpath={.dockerImageReference}'
172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/ubuntu@sha256:be159ff0e12a38fd2208022484bee14412680727ec992680b66cdead1ba76d19
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you re-push the images you need to restart all the OpenShift
Container registry's pods to reset all the caches.
